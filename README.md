## Project Description

The project aims to develop an automated system for extracting information from BOJA using NLP techniques. By identifying patterns and extracting structured data, the system provides relevant and coherent search results.

## Motivation

The main motivation is to address the challenge of managing and searching the vast amount of information published in BOJA, making it more accessible and useful for different users including researchers, professionals, and the general public.

## Methodology

The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, which includes the following phases:
1. **Business Understanding**
2. **Data Understanding**
3. **Data Preparation**
4. **Modeling**
5. **Evaluation**
6. **Deployment**
